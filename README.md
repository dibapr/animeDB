# animeDB
PHP CRUD about anime database

My first project using Database (PHP MYSQL)

Further update required - I'm stuck at editing the data, specifically displaying the current genre, error when I do not editing the image, and somehow my MYSQL query is wrong. Anyone who wants to improve this project are gladly welcomed.

Tools:
- XAMPP
- PHPMyAdmin
- Bootstrap
- SweetAlert2 (Message doesn't displaying)

Installation:
1. NPM (Installing JQuery and Bootstrap Icon)
- `npm install jquery`
- `npm i bootstrap-icons`
2. Export "animek.sql" into PhpMyAdmin
3. Open XAMPP Control Panel and turn-on Apache and MySQL
4. Open 'localhost/animek' in your browser
