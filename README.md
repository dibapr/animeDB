PHP CRUD about anime database

My first project using Database (PHP MYSQL)
// Further update required - I'm stuck at editing the data, specifically displaying the current genre, error when I do not editing the image, and somehow my MYSQL query is wrong. Anyone who wants to improve this project are gladly welecomed.

Tools:
- XAMPP
- PHPMyAdmin
- Bootstrap
- SweetAlert2 (Message doesn't displaying)
